## Some opening words.
I was originally planning to use a Google Doc for this, but they just made embedding Gfycat videos infinitely harder.

<div style='position:relative; padding-bottom:calc(56.33% + 44px)'><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/ChubbyOilyAntipodesgreenparakeet' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style='position:absolute;top:0;left:0;' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p> <a href="https://gfycat.com/chubbyoilyantipodesgreenparakeet">via Gfycat</a></p>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kenesu-h/crowdplay-bot-rs/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
